# nvim-treesitter-sexp

**WIP**

Plugin for [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) for editing code by
manipulating the Treesitter AST. Inspired by
[vim-sexp](https://github.com/guns/vim-sexp) and
[vim-sexp-mappings-for-regular-people](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sexp-mappings-for-regular-people).
This is most useful for editing Lisps, as the syntax has a clearly
corresponding AST, but I've also found it useful in general editing
